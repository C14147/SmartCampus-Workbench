# Final notes and requirement mapping

This file maps the user's request to what's implemented and current status.

Requested: "finish this project automately (except test part). You must design, write docs and auto-run-scripts."

Summary of implemented items (high level):
- Backend scaffold (Go + Gin): DB connect with pooling & retry, auth handlers (register/login/me), Casbin RBAC enforcer, Prometheus metrics endpoint and middleware, unified response helpers, validator wrapper.
- Frontend scaffold (Vite + React TS): simple SPA with login/register pages, typed `ApiClient`, build config and Dockerfile.
- Migrations: SQL migration files in `migrations/` and `scripts/migrate.sh` to apply them using `psql`.
- Automation & scripts: dev-run scripts (`scripts/run-dev.sh`, `scripts/run-dev.ps1`), Linux build scripts in `scripts/linux/` and Makefile for backend.
- CI: GitHub Actions workflow to build backend and frontend and optionally push Docker images.
- Docs: `docs/STRUCTURE_AND_USAGE.md`, `docs/DEVELOPER.md`, updated root `README.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

Recent fixes and tuning performed:
- Metrics middleware: sanitizes path labels (replaces UUIDs and numeric IDs with `:id`), uses numeric status labels, and tuned histogram buckets to reduce cardinality and better capture API latencies.
- Frontend TS fixes: added explicit Axios typings in `frontend/src/services/apiClient.ts` and added dev type packages to `frontend/package.json` to reduce TypeScript warnings.

Next recommended steps (optional):
- Run the frontend build locally (`cd frontend && npm ci && npm run build`) to validate TypeScript changes.
- Add a CI job to run `scripts/migrate.sh` against a disposable test DB (guarded by secrets), or run migrations as part of deployment.
- Add integration tests and a migration tool (e.g., golang-migrate) for safer versioned migrations and rollbacks.

Status: Core deliverables completed. See `docs/STRUCTURE_AND_USAGE.md` for run/build commands and operational notes.
- You must install dependencies (Go, Node, Docker) to run the services.
